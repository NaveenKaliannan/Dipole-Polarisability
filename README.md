# Dipole-Polarisability program
This program computes the molecular dipole moment, molecular polarisability, radial distribution function, cosine functions, translational and rotational correlation functions, and translational and rotational kinetic energies for a number of aqueous systems, including pure liquid water, MgCl2, Na2SO4, NaF, and NaCl salt solutions, using simulated MD trajectories from CP2K, Gromacs, and Tinker.

The molecular dipole moment and polarizability are calculated using the first and second hyperpolarizabilities extended dipole-induced-dipole formalism reported in our papers [1,2].
