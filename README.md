# Dipole-Polarisability program
This program computes the molecular dipole moment and polarisability for various aqueous systems such as pure liquid water, MgCl2, Na2SO4, NaF, NaCl salt solutions etc, simulated via CP2K, Gromacs, Tinker. Both the quantities are calculated using the first and second hyperpolarizabilities extended dipole-induced-dipole formalism [1].
