# Dipole-Polarisability program
This program computes the molecular dipole moment, molecular polarisability, radial distribution function, cosine functions, translational and rotational correlation functions, and translational and rotational kinetic energies for a number of aqueous systems, including pure liquid water, MgCl2, Na2SO4, NaF, and NaCl salt solutions, using simulated MD trajectories from CP2K, Gromacs, and Tinker.
